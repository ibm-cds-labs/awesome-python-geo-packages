# Awesome Python Geo Packages

A list of awesome geodata and related Python packages (loosely) sorted by function. The main inspiration to start this list was the [GeoPython conference](https://2017.geopython.net/) in May 2017, where many of these projects were presented.

## Notebooks

* [ipython](http://ipython.org/)
* [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)
* 

## Data Types

### Points, lines and polygons

* [json](http://python-guide-pt-br.readthedocs.io/en/latest/scenarios/json/)
* [geojson](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/geojson)

### Rasters and grids

* [netCDF4](http://unidata.github.io/netcdf4-python/) 
* [OGC netCDF standard](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/netcdf)

### Hexagons

## Data Processing

* [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/) is an ecosystem of open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering 
* [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) is a library for scientific computing
* [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) is a library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools ([Example notebook](https://datascience.ibm.com/blog/analyse-open-data-sets-using-pandas-in-a-python-notebook-2/))
* [geopandas](http://geopandas.org/) extends the datatypes used by pandas to allow spatial operations on geometric types
* [meza]

## 3D mapping

* [pyRT](https://github.com/martinchristen/pyRT) is a raytracer/image generator.

## Visualisation

* [PixieDust](https://ibm-cds-labs.github.io/pixiedust/)
* [ArcGIS](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-python-api)
* [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) is a 2D plotting library 
* bokeh 
* bokeh maps
* mapbox
* google

## Miscelaneous

* [Conda](https://conda.io/docs/intro.html) for package, dependency and environment management
* [Dask](http://dask.pydata.org/en/latest/) is a flexible parallel computing library for analytic computing
* [PyToolz](https://github.com/pytoolz/toolz) is a set of utility functions for iterators, functions, and dictionaries
* [Numba](https://github.com/numba/numba) is a compiler for Python code
* [xarray](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/) aims to bring the labeled data power of pandas to the physical sciences, by providing N-dimensional variants of the core pandas data structures
